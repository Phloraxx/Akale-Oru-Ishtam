# Akale Oru Ishtam


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Love from Afar


### Team Members
- Member 1: Sourav P Bijoy - Sahrdaya College of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
A Tinder-like mobile app where students don't create profiles for themselves. Instead, they find lonely objects around campus, give them a one-word vibe, and our AI Vibe Generator creates a full, witty, Gen Z-style dating profile for that object. The entire campus can then swipe, match, and ponder the romantic future of our beloved pens and pencils.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Crushing loneliness of inanimate objects on college campuses.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
'Akale Oru Ishtam' - Tinder for inanimate objects around college campuses.
